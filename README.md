# esp32_prayer_times
it is a program to fetch prayer times from islamicfinder website and display it on oled screen

I used http thingspeak to fetch data from a normal html site

however I think that using http request and some web scraping algorithm is way more better , but
in the end it is my second try in IOT devices

it supports esp 32/8266
